## Validation boundaries

PostgreSQL query results are checked with deterministic fixtures. Native PostgreSQL CI checks the index and pruning labs. SQL Server and cloud warehouse guidance is source-backed but requires those platforms for execution. Multi-session replication, failover, and sharding behavior is explained through scenarios rather than simulated by single-session tests.

## Start with what the data promises

A completed pipeline can still publish duplicate events, outdated dimensions or incorrect totals. To reason about a system, identify the intended record grain, source guarantees, processing latency and the point at which output becomes safe for consumers.

The chapters follow an event from source to warehouse, including how records are reprocessed when a source, worker or sink fails. Cloud services are examples, not substitutes for those decisions.

## Chapters

- [Pipeline architecture]({{ '/data-engineering/foundations/overview/' | relative_url }}) — ETL, ELT, batch, streaming, and choosing where transformations run.
- [Incremental ingestion & CDC]({{ '/data-engineering/incremental/overview/' | relative_url }}) — Watermarks, change streams, idempotency and recovery.
- [Storage & modeling]({{ '/data-engineering/storage/overview/' | relative_url }}) — File formats, lakehouse tables, facts, dimensions, and history.
- [GCP & BigQuery]({{ '/data-engineering/gcp/overview/' | relative_url }}) — Query execution, physical layout, capacity and costs.
- [Distributed processing]({{ '/data-engineering/processing/overview/' | relative_url }}) — Spark, Beam, Dataflow, event time, and skew.
- [Orchestration & transformations]({{ '/data-engineering/orchestration/overview/' | relative_url }}) — Airflow, Cloud Composer, dbt, retries, and backfills.
- [Reliability & operations]({{ '/data-engineering/reliability/overview/' | relative_url }}) — Data quality, schema evolution, data contracts, migrations and incident recovery.

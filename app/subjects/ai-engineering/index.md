## Start from what the model is actually doing

The current Artificial Intelligence (AI) Engineering trail focuses on large language model (LLM) inference and serving. A hosted model can hide most of that machinery until latency, capacity, cost, or a production failure makes the execution path relevant.

The trail starts with one model request, then adds serving, deployment, production traffic, and observability around it.

{% capture diagram_code %}
flowchart LR
A["Prompt"] --> B["Inference"]
B --> C["Serving"]
C --> D["Deployment"]
D --> E["Production traffic"]
E --> F["Observability"]
{% endcapture %}
{% capture diagram_fallback %}
Prompt → Inference → Serving → Deployment → Production traffic → Observability
{% endcapture %}
{% include diagram.html title="From a model call to a production service" code=diagram_code fallback=diagram_fallback caption=true %}

Each component should answer a concrete question: where the request goes, where it can wait, how inference runs, how capacity changes, and which signals explain a slowdown.

## Keep the boundary with general infrastructure clear

Docker, Kubernetes, Services, probes, the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA), and node autoscaling are not LLM concepts. Their mechanics live under [Infrastructure & DevOps]({{ '/infrastructure/' | relative_url }}).

The AI pages use those mechanisms where the LLM changes the decision: a replica may need several GPUs, model startup can require moving tens of gigabytes before readiness, and GPU utilization alone may not tell you whether another request will meet its latency target.

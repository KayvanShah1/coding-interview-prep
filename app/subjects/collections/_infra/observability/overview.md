Monitoring usually starts from conditions you already know to watch: latency above a threshold, an error-rate spike, a failed health check, or a saturated resource. Observability is the evidence available when you need to explain why the system reached that state.

Metrics show how behavior changes over time, logs preserve event detail, and traces connect one request across components. None of the three is sufficient for every incident; correlation between them shortens the path from symptom to cause.

Operationally, the sequence is usually:

```text
alert / user symptom
→ identify affected service and time window
→ inspect metrics
→ follow traces or request IDs
→ read the relevant logs
→ confirm the failing component or dependency
```

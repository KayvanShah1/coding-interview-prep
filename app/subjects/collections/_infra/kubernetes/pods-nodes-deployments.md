A **node** is a machine in the cluster. A **Pod** is Kubernetes' smallest deployable compute unit. A **Deployment** is a controller-level object commonly used to keep a desired set of interchangeable Pods running.

## Node: the resource pool

A node contributes CPU, memory, local storage, networking, and possibly GPUs or other devices.

The scheduler considers Pod resource requests and constraints when deciding which node can run it.

## Pod: the scheduling and lifecycle unit

A Pod contains one or more tightly coupled containers that share a network namespace and can share volumes.

Most application Pods contain one main application container, but a Pod can also include init containers or sidecars where the lifecycle relationship makes sense.

Kubernetes schedules Pods, not arbitrary individual containers.

## Deployment: desired replicated workload

A Deployment describes a desired Pod template and replica count.

If:

`desired replicas = 4`

but only three matching Pods exist, the control loop creates another.

If the Pod template changes, the Deployment coordinates replacement through ReplicaSets.

The important mental model is **desired state versus actual state**.

## What happens when a Pod dies?

For a Deployment-managed stateless workload, a controller creates replacement work. The replacement Pod is a new Pod; Kubernetes does not resurrect the old one as an immortal object.

If the failure came from a dead node, the new Pod may be scheduled elsewhere if suitable capacity exists.

## Scheduling and control are separate

The Deployment/controller decides that a Pod should exist.

The scheduler decides where an unscheduled Pod should run.

The kubelet on that node works with the container runtime to start and supervise the Pod's containers.

That separation becomes important during autoscaling:

```text
autoscaler increases desired replicas
→ controller creates Pods
→ scheduler tries to place them
→ node autoscaler may need to create machines
```

An **image** is the packaged filesystem and metadata used to start a process environment. A **container** is a running instance created from that image.

A **registry** distributes images between build systems and machines that need to run them.

## The lifecycle

```text
Dockerfile / build context
        ↓
      image
        ↓
   push to registry
        ↓
   pull to a host
        ↓
  container runtime
        ↓
 running container
```

If ten replicas use the same image, you do not have ten different source artifacts. You have ten running instances derived from a versioned image.

## What belongs in the image?

Usually:

```text
application binary/code
runtime dependencies
system libraries
startup command
configuration defaults
```

Secrets and environment-specific configuration generally should not be permanently baked into the image.

Large mutable data also deserves separate treatment. A large language model (LLM) checkpoint, for example, can be mounted or downloaded independently rather than forcing every code change to rebuild a huge image.

## Tags are convenient; digests are precise

An image tag such as `my-app:1.4` is human-friendly and can be moved depending on registry policy.

A content digest identifies an exact image manifest/content.

For reproducible production deployment, know which exact artifact ran, not only which friendly tag someone intended to use.

## Registry versus repository

A registry is the service storing/distributing images. Inside it, repositories group related images/tags.

Examples include Docker Hub and cloud/vendor registries.

The practical reason a registry exists is that the machine running a workload should not need your source tree and local build environment. It needs a known image artifact it can pull and execute.

## Containerization solves consistency, not orchestration

Docker does not inherently decide:

- which machine should run the workload;
- how many replicas you need;
- how traffic reaches them;
- what happens if a machine dies.

That is where an orchestrator such as Kubernetes enters.

For graphics processing unit (GPU) workloads, one more interface matters: the image contains userspace libraries, but the physical GPU and kernel driver belong to the host. Continue to [How containers use GPUs]({{ '/infrastructure/containers/gpu-containers/' | relative_url }}).

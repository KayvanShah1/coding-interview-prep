Large language model (LLM) observability connects user-visible latency to queueing, token generation, key-value (KV) cache pressure, and graphics processing unit (GPU) state. A high GPU-utilization number by itself cannot tell you which of those paths is causing the delay.

## In this chapter

<ul class="topic-list">
<li><a href="{{ '/ai-engineering/observability/metrics/' | relative_url }}">What to measure in LLM serving</a><span>Separate user latency, serving pressure, GPU state, and economics.</span></li>
<li><a href="{{ '/ai-engineering/observability/debugging/' | relative_url }}">Debugging a slow or saturated LLM service</a><span>Use TTFT, queue time, prompt length, TPOT, KV cache, and startup state to narrow the bottleneck.</span></li>
</ul>

The useful path is short: start with the user-visible symptom, then follow the few signals that can explain it. Time to first token (TTFT) and time per output token (TPOT) split waiting/prefill from ongoing generation before lower-level metrics enter the investigation.

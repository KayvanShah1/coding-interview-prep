The same distributed-systems fundamentals still apply: load balancing, replication, bounded queues, backpressure, health checks, rollouts, capacity planning, observability, and failure domains.

What changes is the resource profile. Model replicas are large, accelerator-bound, stateful during generation, and expensive to start.

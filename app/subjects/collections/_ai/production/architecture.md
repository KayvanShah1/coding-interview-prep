A large language model (LLM) serving path is easier to reason about when every component owns a specific decision. If two boxes cannot be distinguished by responsibility, the diagram is not helping.

## Data path: where the request goes

**Load balancer / API gateway:** terminates external traffic and commonly owns authentication, quotas, request validation, and rate limits.

**Model router:** chooses a model, version, region, or serving replica. It may be simple or inference-aware.

**Admission control / bounded queue:** prevents unlimited work from entering a finite serving system.

**Inference replica:** owns the model execution environment.

**Inference scheduler:** decides how active sequences share execution and cache capacity.

**Graphics processing unit (GPU):** performs the tensor computation.

## Control path: how serving capacity exists

**Kubernetes:** keeps the declared workloads running and places Pods on suitable nodes.

**Workload autoscaler:** changes the desired number of serving replicas from metrics or events. The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) are common Kubernetes examples.

**Node autoscaler:** obtains or removes machines when the current cluster cannot place those replicas. Karpenter and cluster autoscalers are examples.

**Observability:** provides the evidence used for scaling, SLOs, and debugging.

## The “who does what?” map

| Layer | Main responsibility | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Container image | Package the serving software environment | Docker / OCI image |
| Workload orchestrator | Maintain, place, and roll workload replicas | Kubernetes |
| Service/gateway | Expose traffic, enforce policy, and route requests | API gateway / Service |
| Workload autoscaler | Change desired replica count | HPA / KEDA |
| Node autoscaler | Change machine capacity | Karpenter / cluster autoscaler |
| Inference engine | Schedule and execute LLM inference | vLLM / SGLang |
| Telemetry | Expose and collect evidence for operations and scaling | metrics / logs / traces |

Higher-level serving frameworks and general inference servers can compose around these layers. The [inference engine page]({{ '/ai-engineering/serving/inference-engines/' | relative_url }}) keeps those tool boundaries in one place instead of repeating the ecosystem here.

## Same fundamentals, different bottleneck

A normal backend may saturate on central processing unit (CPU) capacity, database connections, or I/O.

An LLM service can saturate on:

```text
GPU compute
GPU memory / key-value (KV) cache
inter-GPU communication
request queue
model startup capacity
token throughput
```

The architecture fundamentals survive. The useful signals and cost of a replica change.

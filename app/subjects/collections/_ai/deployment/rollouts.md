A normal backend can often start in seconds. A large language model (LLM) replica may need a scarce graphics processing unit (GPU) node, a large checkpoint, runtime initialization, and warmup before it is ready.

That makes rollout capacity a first-class concern.

## A safe replacement sequence

For one replica:

```text
new version requested
→ new Pod scheduled
→ image/model become available
→ model loads and warms
→ readiness succeeds
→ traffic shifts
→ old replica drains and stops
```

The old serving capacity should not disappear before enough new capacity is actually ready.

## Rolling updates trade time for temporary overlap

Kubernetes Deployments gradually create a new ReplicaSet and scale down the old one. `maxSurge` and `maxUnavailable` control how much temporary extra capacity and how much temporary loss are allowed.

For central processing unit (CPU) services, a little surge may be cheap.

For an LLM where each replica consumes several expensive GPUs, “one extra replica during rollout” can be a meaningful capacity and cost decision.

## Canary when correctness or performance may change

A new model or runtime version can change:

- answer quality;
- tokenization or generation behavior;
- memory use;
- time to first token (TTFT) / time per output token (TPOT);
- throughput;
- failure rate;
- tool-call behavior.

Sending a small percentage of traffic to the new version lets you compare those signals before full rollout.

A canary is not useful if you only watch process health. Model quality and serving performance are part of the release.

## Blue-green buys simpler rollback at higher capacity cost

With blue-green, the old and new fleets coexist and traffic switches between them.

Rollback is operationally simple because the old fleet is still present, but GPU duplication can be expensive. This pattern makes more sense when the release risk justifies the temporary capacity.

## Prewarm when startup latency is predictable and painful

A rollout can provision nodes and load the new model before shifting traffic. That turns some cold-start time into planned deployment work rather than user-visible queueing.

The same idea appears in autoscaling: spare warm capacity costs money but reduces the delay between demand arriving and useful inference capacity becoming ready.

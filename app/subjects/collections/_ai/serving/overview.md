One running large language model (LLM) server can answer requests. A production serving system has to answer a different question: **how do we keep latency and throughput acceptable when requests arrive concurrently and individual requests have very different token lengths?**

An **inference engine** schedules model execution. The **serving platform** gets traffic to enough healthy inference replicas and manages the capacity around them.

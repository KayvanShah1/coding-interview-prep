A normal prediction endpoint often looks like one bounded computation:

`features → model → prediction`.

A large language model (LLM) request has a different shape. The prompt is processed, then generation repeatedly produces another token until a stopping condition is reached.

## One model step still contains the transformer

Prefill and decode describe **when** the model runs. Inside each model step, the computation still passes through the transformer:

```text
token IDs
→ embeddings
→ transformer layers
   → self-attention
   → feed-forward network
→ final hidden state
→ vocabulary logits
→ select / sample next token
```

During prefill, this computation covers the prompt positions needed to build reusable attention state. During decode, the same model produces the logits for the next token while reusing cached attention state from earlier tokens.

This page stays at the serving-level view. Attention heads, positional encoding, residual connections, normalization, and training belong in a deeper transformer chapter.

## The prompt is not generated token by token

Suppose the request contains 2,000 input tokens. The model can process those prompt tokens together to establish the attention state needed for generation. This stage is **prefill**.

Once prefill completes, the model begins **decode**. At each decode step it produces logits for the next token, selects or samples a token, then uses that new token as part of the state for the following step.

A 300-token answer therefore involves roughly 300 sequential decode steps. Work inside each step is massively parallel on a graphics processing unit (GPU), but token 250 cannot be finalized before the state produced by token 249 exists.

That sequential dependency is why an LLM endpoint behaves differently from a classifier that returns one score after a single forward pass.

## Streaming changes the user experience, not the underlying work

The server does not need to wait for the complete answer before returning anything. Once the first output token is ready, it can stream generated text to the client while later decode steps continue.

This gives two different latency questions:

- **How long until generation starts?** This is captured by time to first token, or TTFT.
- **How quickly does generation continue?** This is captured by inter-token latency or time per output token.

A request can have a good TTFT and still feel slow if decode is slow. It can also generate quickly once started but have a poor TTFT because it waited in a queue or processed a very long prompt.

## Input and output length stress different parts of the path

A long prompt increases prefill work and creates more attention state. A long answer keeps the request active through more decode steps.

That means two requests are not equivalent merely because both count as one HTTP request:

| Request | Likely pressure |
|---|---|
| Short prompt, short answer | Small amount of serving work |
| Long prompt, short answer | Heavy prefill and key-value (KV) cache allocation |
| Short prompt, long answer | Long-lived decode work |
| Long prompt, long answer | Both memory pressure and sustained generation |

This is why production LLM systems often reason in tokens and active sequences rather than requests per second alone.

## What the inference engine has to manage

At this layer the engine is concerned with the model execution itself: loading weights, allocating model and cache memory, scheduling sequences, building efficient batches, executing kernels, and returning generated tokens.

Kubernetes does not decide which token should run next. A load balancer does not manage the KV cache. Those responsibilities belong deeper in the inference runtime.

Continue to [Prefill, decode, and KV cache]({{ '/ai-engineering/inference/prefill-decode-kv-cache/' | relative_url }}) before thinking about replicas. The amount of per-request state determines how many requests one replica can keep active.

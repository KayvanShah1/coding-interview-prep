Large language model (LLM) inference can be expensive for different reasons: model memory, key-value (KV) cache pressure, prefill work, sequential decode, or underused accelerator capacity. The optimization should match the bottleneck.

## If model weights consume too much memory: quantize

Lower-precision weight formats reduce the memory footprint of the model and can improve execution efficiency on supported hardware.

A 70-billion-parameter (70B) model needs roughly:

`70B parameters × 2 bytes ≈ 140 GB`

for 16-bit weights before other memory.

Moving to a lower-bit representation can cut that substantially, but the real outcome depends on the quantization method, hardware, kernels, and acceptable quality change.

The decision is not “4-bit is always better.” Ask whether the target is **fit**, **throughput**, **cost**, or **latency**, then benchmark quality and performance on the actual workload.

## If KV memory is fragmented or poorly utilized: manage it in blocks

vLLM's PagedAttention work popularized treating KV-cache memory more like paged/block-managed storage than reserving one large contiguous region per sequence.

Conceptually:

`[A][A][B][C][A][B][D] ...`

Variable-length requests make naïve memory reservation wasteful. Block-based allocation lets more active request state fit in the same video memory (VRAM) budget.

## If prompts repeat: reuse prefix work

Many production requests share long prefixes: a system prompt, tool definitions, policy instructions, a common document header, or the beginning of a multi-turn conversation.

Prefix caching can reuse previously computed KV state for matching prefixes instead of recomputing the same prefill work.

The gain depends on actual reuse. A cache with almost no repeated prefixes adds memory and bookkeeping without much benefit.

Routing can then become cache-aware: if replica A already holds a useful prefix, sending the related request to replica A may avoid work. That is an optimization layer, not a requirement for a basic serving system.

## If sequential decode is the bottleneck: speculative decoding

Speculative decoding uses cheaper proposal work to suggest multiple future tokens and lets the target model verify them. When several proposals are accepted, the system advances farther than one normal token step for part of the workload.

It is useful when the extra proposer/verification work produces enough accepted tokens to reduce effective generation time. It is not free acceleration for every model and traffic pattern.

## If prompts are large: schedule prefill carefully

Large prefills can monopolize execution and hurt other requests' first-token latency. Two related approaches attack that interference at different levels.

### Chunked prefill shares one serving pool more carefully

Instead of processing one large prompt as a single block of work, the scheduler can break prefill into chunks and interleave it with decode work already in flight.

That can improve fairness between long prompts and interactive generation without changing the basic deployment shape:

`same replica → prefill chunks + decode work`.

The trade-off moves into scheduling. Chunk size and scheduling policy can improve one latency metric while hurting another, so this should be tuned against the actual prompt distribution rather than enabled because “chunking is faster.”

### Disaggregated prefill separates the phases

A more structural design runs prefill and decode on different serving instances:

```text
prompt
  ↓
prefill pool
  ↓  KV state transfer
decode pool
  ↓
generated tokens
```

This matters because prefill and decode stress hardware differently. Separate pools can use different parallelism or capacity settings and let operators tune **time to first token (TTFT)** and **inter-token latency** more independently.

The price is an extra distributed-systems problem: the KV state produced during prefill has to reach the decode worker efficiently. Network bandwidth, KV-transfer mechanisms, routing, and failure handling now become part of the serving path.

vLLM currently describes disaggregated prefilling as experimental. Its documentation is also explicit that the feature is primarily about controlling latency behavior, not magically increasing total throughput.

This becomes most relevant when long-context prefill and latency-sensitive decode compete heavily enough that scheduler tuning inside one replica is no longer sufficient.

## If the request does not need the largest model: route differently

Infrastructure optimization is not the only cost lever.

A router can send simpler work to a smaller model, reserve a larger model for harder requests, or choose a specialized model for embeddings or code. The trade-off moves from pure systems tuning into quality measurement: the cheaper route is only useful if it still meets the task's quality bar.

## Keep the decision table in mind

| Bottleneck | Candidate lever |
|---|---|
| Weights do not fit / VRAM expensive | Quantization, more/smaller model choice |
| KV-cache pressure | Better cache allocation, shorter context, more capacity |
| Repeated prompt prefill | Prefix caching |
| Decode latency | Speculative decoding, faster kernels/hardware |
| Long prompt interference | Chunked/disaggregated prefill |
| Cost from over-capable models | Model routing |
| Low graphics processing unit (GPU) utilization | Better scheduling/batching |

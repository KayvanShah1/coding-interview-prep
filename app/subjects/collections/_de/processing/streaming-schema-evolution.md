An order producer adds `discount_amount` at noon. Some service instances still publish the old event, while others publish the new one. A consumer is hours behind and may first encounter the older version. A streaming aggregation also has window state written by yesterday's code. The warehouse might be able to add a nullable column, but that fixes only one part of the deployment.

A stream keeps processing while application versions change. The rollout has to account for messages already in the log, consumers still running older code, records buffered in the processor, and state saved by previous deployments. Batch transformations often have a scheduled point at which new code can take over; a live stream usually does not.

## Event-driven pipelines without medallion stages

A low-latency payment-risk service might look like this:

~~~text
payment API
  → Kafka topic: payments.events
  → Flink / Kafka Streams: detect unusual velocity
  → risk service or alert topic
  → separate sink for analytics
~~~

The payment-risk processor reads from the topic and publishes a decision directly. A separate consumer could archive the same events or load BigQuery for analytics. In this setup, the topic's event contract and the processor's expectations control the live decision.

Some streaming platforms also use Bronze, Silver and Gold datasets. This payment service has no such intermediate tables. Adding a field might work in the archive but fail during decoding, or change the inputs to a risk calculation. Each consumer has to decide whether it can handle the new event version.

## Event, processor-state, and sink compatibility

| Interface | What can break | Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Producer → event log → consumer | An old consumer cannot decode a newly written event, or a new consumer cannot replay older records | Versioned event schemas, serializer/deserializer rules, compatibility policy and rollout order |
| Stream processor → checkpointed state | A new job cannot restore an old aggregate, timer, window or key-value state | Compatible serializers, savepoints/checkpoints, upgrade validation or state migration |
| Processor → sink / external consumer | A database rejects a row, a downstream event changes meaning, or a dashboard expects an old field | Sink schema policy, explicit mappings, parallel versions, consumer contracts and reconciliation |

Kafka brokers store and deliver message bytes. Producers and consumers apply the schema format through serializers, deserializers and validation; a schema registry can enforce compatibility when new schemas are registered. Any Kafka Streams or Flink transformation using the changed fields still needs review.

## Decoding mixed event versions

With registered Avro or Protocol Buffers events, the producer writes data using a known schema and includes a **schema identifier** in an agreed wire format or message envelope. A consumer uses the identifier to load the writer's definition. Avro supports reader/writer schema resolution; Protocol Buffers handles fields according to its own compatibility rules. Busy consumers normally cache schema definitions instead of fetching them for every event.

For example, a Kafka topic can contain the following logical events:

~~~json
{"schema_version": 1, "payment_id": "p1", "amount": 100}
{"schema_version": 2, "payment_id": "p2", "amount": 200, "discount_amount": 10}
~~~

These JSON records show the idea; a registered Avro or Protobuf message normally uses its own serialization format and metadata. A consumer built for version 2 may default a missing `discount_amount` to zero when reading version 1, **if the serialization format and schema definition support that default**. The consumer's business calculation still has to decide whether zero really means no discount.

When old and new event versions require different decoding or field mapping, an adapter can publish a common event format:

~~~text
payments.events.v1 ─┐
                    ├→ version-aware adapter → payment canonical event → consumers
payments.events.v2 ─┘
~~~

A normalizer may be a stream-processing job or a small service. It maps supported versions to a stable event contract; an unknown or invalid version goes to a classified error path for repair or replay. A new topic/version is often warranted when required fields, keys, or business meaning change incompatibly.

## Backward, forward and full compatibility: deployment order

These terms have precise reader/writer meanings, and permitted field changes vary across Avro, Protobuf and JSON Schema.

| Policy | Guarantee | Typical rollout implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BACKWARD` | New reader can handle data from the previous writer version | Upgrade consumers first, then producers |
| `FORWARD` | Old reader can handle data from the new writer version | Producers can move first, but consumers upgrading afterward may still encounter older retained messages |
| `FULL` | Both reader directions work for the compared versions | Consumers and producers have more freedom to roll independently |
| `*_TRANSITIVE` | Compare against **all** earlier registered versions | Valuable when long-retained data can be replayed months later |

Confluent Schema Registry defaults to `BACKWARD`, not `BACKWARD_TRANSITIVE`. With the non-transitive setting, passing a new-versus-previous check does not prove that a consumer can read every historic version in the topic. Long Kafka retention, disaster recovery and reprocessing often motivate stronger compatibility policies and explicit replay tests.

Upgrade order is particularly important when an old consumer cannot decode the new producer's messages. It also depends on whether the consumer is stateless or stores changelog/state data. Confluent's documentation calls out Kafka Streams separately because the upgraded application may need to read previously serialized state as well as input events.

## Rolling out a new event field

Suppose the payment team adds an optional `merchant_category` field and the new fraud rules will use it.

1. Define and register a compatible schema version. Test serialization with old/new producer and consumer combinations and with historic retained messages.
2. Upgrade the streaming consumer to accept both versions. The new rule must handle the field being absent until producers are fully updated.
3. Roll out producers gradually. During the overlap, both event versions are valid on the same topic. Monitor decode failures, null/missing rates, consumer lag and the results of risk calculations.
4. Only after event coverage and consumer migration are verified should the business consider making `merchant_category` required or retiring compatibility logic.

If the new attribute is missing for historical events, the correct fallback is a domain decision. Imputing a convenient value can change fraud scores, revenue totals or eligibility logic.

A rename from `amount` to `total_amount` changes the field contract. The consuming team needs an approved alias or mapping, plus a migration plan for older events and applications.

## Migrating stateful Flink and Dataflow jobs

Imagine a rolling five-minute payment total keyed by `account_id`. A Flink job keeps per-key aggregates and timers in managed state. Updating the event decoder might be safe, while changing the key type or the serialized aggregate breaks state restoration.

Apache Flink can restore from a **savepoint** when the restored job and its serializers can read the saved state. Some changes to a state schema can be migrated automatically. Changing the key type, serializer, operator identity or a complex state layout can prevent restoration. The team then has to plan a state transformation, rebuild from a controlled replay point or run old and new jobs in parallel during the transition.

Google Cloud Dataflow has a related but distinct update model. A **replacement job** can preserve intermediate state and in-flight records when its pipeline graph and coders are compatible. The documented schema changes permitted for schema-aware Apache Beam `PCollection` updates include adding fields and making required fields nullable. Removing fields, renaming fields and changing field types are not permitted by that update mechanism. Other pipeline-graph and coder changes may also block replacement. In such cases, Dataflow documents **parallel pipelines** as one migration option. The cutover still needs a strategy for duplicate outputs, in-flight work and sink ownership.

Test event decoding and state restoration independently. A passing registry compatibility check cannot establish that the upgraded job will restore yesterday's checkpoint.

## Pub/Sub → Dataflow → BigQuery on GCP

A real-time GCP implementation might be:

~~~text
application
  → Pub/Sub (Avro / Protobuf schema and revisions)
  → Dataflow / Apache Beam (decode, validate, normalize)
      ├→ BigQuery real-time table
      ├→ Cloud Storage raw archive
      └→ classified invalid-message sink / dead-letter queue
~~~

Pub/Sub can validate published messages against an attached schema and its allowed revisions, rejecting nonconforming publishes. Its schema revisions use stricter compatibility constraints than arbitrary changes to a JSON payload, and consumers can use revision metadata to decode messages. A Pub/Sub topic without a schema attachment does not obtain those checks automatically.

The Dataflow code still defines the output fields and business rules. On an additive event-field change, it may keep writing the old stable BigQuery projection until a reviewed update exposes the new field. The destination needs its own compatible change, and historical rows will not automatically gain meaningful values.

For a disruptive sink migration, old and new pipelines can write to separate staging tables while a stable view serves consumers. If both versions append to the same production table without coordinated ownership or deduplication, the cutover can duplicate business events.

## Malformed messages, replay and a safe cutover

A decoder cannot process an arbitrary future version just because the event contains a schema ID. Decide what happens to an unrecognized schema, malformed value or impossible enum. Depending on the system, reject publication, isolate the record for later repair or route processing failures to a dead-letter queue (DLQ). Put event IDs, schema versions and error reasons in that record; avoid endless retries of permanently malformed messages.

Messages in a DLQ still need a repair or replay path. Record topic retention, raw archives, checkpoints or offsets, and the sink's idempotency key. During cutover, compare both pipeline versions over a defined time window, then reconcile counts, keys and business measures before switching consumers.

For a streaming deployment, watch **schema/decoder failures, message age and consumer lag, checkpoint or replacement-job failures, DLQ volume, duplicate sink writes and output discrepancies**. A deployment can be technically healthy while its fraud logic or aggregate amounts are wrong.

## Choosing a streaming migration strategy

The appropriate migration depends on how independently consumers deploy and what happens if a record is processed incorrectly:

- A short-lived internal stream with coordinated deployments can rely on a compatible additive change and tests.
- A shared topic with independently deployed consumers benefits from a registry, clear compatibility policy, schema-aware serializers and consumer ownership.
- A high-impact breaking change often warrants a versioned event or canonical adapter plus an explicit consumer migration.
- A stateful processor requires separate checkpoint/savepoint compatibility testing.
- An analytics sink needs its own stable output contract; its table-evolution settings are a separate decision from event-schema compatibility.

A rollout plan should name the producer and consumer versions that will overlap, the oldest records that might be replayed, whether persisted state can be restored, and how sinks will switch over. Those details determine which migrations are safe.

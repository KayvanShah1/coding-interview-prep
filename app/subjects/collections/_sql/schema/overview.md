## What rule should the database enforce?

Tables and constraints encode assumptions that query authors otherwise have to guess. Data changes introduce another question: what must happen atomically, and what happens when a write conflicts or repeats?


## Decision reference

| Operation | Start with |
|---|---|
| Define or change structure | CREATE / ALTER TABLE |
| Enforce identity or relationships | PRIMARY KEY / UNIQUE / FOREIGN KEY |
| Enforce row rules | NOT NULL / CHECK |
| Change rows | INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE |
| Handle conflicts | ON CONFLICT / MERGE; engine-specific semantics |

## Check the invariant

For every constraint or write pattern, state the rule the database is protecting. Then ask what happens on duplicate input, partial failure, or a retry.

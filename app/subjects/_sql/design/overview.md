## Start with what one row represents

A schema is a choice about entities, relationships, history, and access. Normalization addresses dependencies; dimensional modeling makes analytical grain and history explicit. Learn what problem each approach solves.


## Decision reference

| Design question | Concept |
|---|---|
| What determines an attribute? | Functional dependency |
| Where should a fact be stored? | Normalization |
| What does a measured row represent? | Fact grain |
| How do attributes change over time? | Slowly changing dimensions |
| Which data can a query skip? | Physical layout; see performance |

<li><a href="{{ '/sql/design/dimensional-modeling/' | relative_url }}">Fact tables, dimensions & slowly changing history</a><span>Choose an analytical grain before choosing keys or columns.</span></li>
</ul>

## Start from the question the model must answer

State the grain first. Then decide where each fact belongs, what can change over time, and which historical answer must remain reproducible.

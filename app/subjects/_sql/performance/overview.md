## Something is slow. What do you check first?

Performance starts with a correct result and a measurable symptom. This chapter moves from plans and access paths to reproducible experiments, then contrasts transactional engines with analytical warehouses.


## Decision reference

| Symptom | First lesson |
|---|---|
| Unclear source of slowness | When and where to optimize |
| Much input, tiny output | Plans and access paths |
| Estimates differ from reality | Statistics and skew |
| Large joins or spills | Joins, sorting, and memory |
| Broad time scans | Predicates and partition pruning |
| Warehouse scan or shuffle cost | Warehouse performance |

## Diagnose before changing anything

Keep the result contract fixed. Capture a baseline, identify the expensive work, make one hypothesis, and measure the change. A faster query that changes rows, grain, or semantics is not an optimization.
